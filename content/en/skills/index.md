        ## Interests
        <div style="text-align: justify;">
          I enjoy playing computer and console games, and I love discovering the charm of various genres and platforms. In particular, I'm interested in analyzing game design and the gameplay experience tailored to each platform's characteristics. For computer games, online multiplayer interactions and community engagement are fascinating, while console games captivate me with the tactile controls of the gamepad and immersive storytelling. With these experiences, I aspire to create games that players can enjoy on both computers and consoles.

          With a passion for game development and an endless curiosity, I aim to participate in various projects to build my experience. By joining boot camps, I seek to enhance my technical skills and learn the importance of team-based development through collaboration. Through this, I want to acquire the skills and communication abilities necessary for game development and play an active role in various game companies. Specifically, my goal is to join leading companies in the Korean game industry, such as Nexon, Netmarble, and NCSoft, and contribute to creative projects. By working with these companies, which have strong game development experience and globally loved titles, I hope to bring joy to players and develop my skills.
