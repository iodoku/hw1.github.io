<h2 style="color:orange;">A Developer Who Wants to Create Joy Through Games!</h2>

Hello! My name is Dongha Jang, and I am passionate about games and game development. Currently, I am studying in the Department of Computer Engineering at Chonbuk National University, and I am developing various games using the Unity engine. My goal is to create content that brings joy to people through games and to develop my expertise in game development.

In particular, one of my biggest dreams is to directly create the fun games that I have enjoyed playing and to see others enjoying them as well. I also wish to implement my creative ideas and offer new experiences through the world of games. I constantly embrace new challenges and experiences as I walk the path of a game developer. Thank you!
